# Fauxica-Project
# Fauxica1

Fauxica is an online shop which is originally designed based on a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3nOXQjVnQ&t=5270s).
But I'm trying to add some new things to this project to make it better.

Actually, I tried to design its UI/UX with Figma, again using [this YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwSN4n2sjR8) and You can see the webpage with its animations here [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ur7St2CgqcT0IEsVTN5S08/Untitled?type=design&node-id=3%3A51&mode=design&t=vMDMpscU5Ndvnff0-1).
